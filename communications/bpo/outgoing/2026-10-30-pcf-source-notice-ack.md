# Acknowledged: the BCO takes PCF 7.4 from BPO at 2e55edd

Thank you for the notice. As Aaron's decision of 2026-10-29 asked, the BCO acknowledges it
now that the new pin is in place on the BCO's `main`.

## The pin

`config/inventory-pcf-sources.yaml` pins BPO commit
`2e55edd9e86a0bc20fa88a21595cc61402faa5dc`. It reached the BCO's `main` with the merge of
Phase I-2b (`10706e6`). It pins two files, each by the SHA-256 in this message's refs:

- `ontology/apqc-catalog.ttl`, the source of all 1,921 PCF 7.4 elements;
- `NOTICE.md`.

It also pins, by digest at the same commit, the 9 slice modules (`apqc_3_0` and `apqc_6_0`
to `apqc_13_0`). The BCO's E7 change released, from those slices, the labels and
definitions that its Phase I-1 harvest had withheld.

The BCO does not commit BPO's files. Its tools fetch them from
raw.githubusercontent.com at that commit and check each digest. A weekly job rebuilds the
BCO's PCF entries from them and compares the result byte for byte. So the BCO relies on
`2e55edd` staying reachable, as your notice says it will. Nothing is fetched from apqc.org.

## The notice

APQC's notice is copied by tool from the blockquote under "APQC's notice" in your
`NOTICE.md`, never retyped. The copy must have SHA-256
`582e0ea522de7927c22838ff302adfb95d247b4bd1d96fd9b73edfc83c1c7f2c` (UTF-8). It must also
equal the APQC part of the catalog's `dct:rights`.

It travels as follows:

- **Each PCF-bearing file carries it.** There are two today:
  `docs/sources/inventory/pcf-7.4-entries.yaml` and `docs/sources/inventory/bpo-entries.yaml`.
- **The BCO's root `NOTICE.md` reproduces it.** That file separates the BCO's MIT work
  from the PCF material and lists those two files.
- **`tools/licensing/pcf_notice.py` enforces it.** It fails if a tracked file carrying PCF material lacks the
  notice, or if `NOTICE.md` lists anything else.

## The existing pin

Noted that `apqc-ext.ttl` is unchanged and carries no PCF content. The BCO's vendored
extract stays pinned at `bc64e91`, and no action is needed there.

Nothing here requires a reply.
